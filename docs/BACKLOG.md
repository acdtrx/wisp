# Backlog

Issues, improvements, and tech debt identified but deferred. Pick up when prioritized.

## How to use this file

Each entry has:
- a short title (used as a header)
- **Found:** date and context
- **Symptom:** what users see (or don't see, for silent bugs)
- **Root cause:** what we know
- **Fix sketch:** the rough plan, not a binding design
- **Why deferred:** the reason it isn't shipping today

When an entry grows beyond a few paragraphs — multiple options to weigh, design tradeoffs,
phased plan — graduate it to `docs/plans/<topic>.md` and replace this entry with a one-line
pointer. Keep this file scannable.

## Improvements

### `text-accent` as link/action text is below AA contrast

**Found:** 2026-07-12, during the text-contrast pass that darkened the text and status tokens to WCAG AA.

**Symptom:** Accent-colored text (`text-accent`, ~29 uses as links/inline actions) sits at 3.1:1 on white — readable but below the 4.5:1 AA threshold for small text. White text on accent buttons has the same 3.1:1 ratio.

**Root cause:** `--color-accent: #0fa396` is the brand color; it was deliberately left out of the contrast pass because darkening it to AA lands near the current hover shade (`#0b8578`) and shifts the brand feel everywhere (buttons, focus rings, active states).

**Fix sketch:** Either darken the accent/hover pair together (e.g. accent ≈ `#0b8578`, hover darker still) and accept the brand shift, or introduce a separate `--color-accent-text` token used only where accent appears as small text, keeping buttons on the current accent.

**Why deferred:** Brand-identity call for the user; the readability complaint that drove the pass was about muted labels, which are fixed.

### Host Mgmt add/edit is inline-row only — no mobile create/edit path

**Found:** 2026-07-06, during the mobile Host Mgmt pass.

**Symptom:** On phones, Host Mgmt (SMB shares, removable drives, VLAN bridges) is read-only + mount/unmount only. Adding, editing, or deleting a mount/bridge, and adopting a detected drive, are all hidden below `sm` because they expand a table row into a multi-field inline editor that doesn't work at narrow widths.

**Root cause:** Create/edit use inline table-row editors (`editingId`/`showCreate` state swapping cells for inputs), a desktop-only interaction.

**Fix sketch:** Replace inline-row editing with a **modal editor** (reuse `Modal.jsx`; `UsbAttachModal` is the closest existing pattern) for add/edit/adopt across the three sections. A modal form works identically on desktop and mobile and would let add/edit/delete return to phones. Do it as one focused pass, not per-section.

**Why deferred:** The read-only+mount mobile view covers the common phone use case; the editor redesign is its own scoped piece.

### `DataTable` numeric `minWidthRem` never generates CSS

**Found:** 2026-07-06, during the mobile table polish.

**Symptom:** None visible — tables size by natural content width, which happens to look right.

**Root cause:** `DataTable` builds `min-w-[${n}rem]` at runtime; Tailwind's scanner never sees the literal class, so no CSS is emitted for the numeric path. Only string-literal values passed by callers (e.g. `"sm:min-w-[56rem]"`) work.

**Fix sketch:** Convert the numeric path to an inline `style={{ minWidth: … }}` (or drop the prop where content width suffices). Note this would *introduce* min-widths that never actually applied — check each table for new scrollbars before shipping.

**Why deferred:** Zero user-visible impact today; changing it silently alters accepted layouts.

### `wisp-os-update upgrade` uses `apt-get upgrade -y` — packages requiring new deps stay kept-back

**Found:** 2026-05-04, during osUpdate apt-path review.

**Symptom:** After clicking Upgrade in the UI, some upgradable packages remain in the next "View packages" list. They are kept back because `apt-get upgrade` (without `dist-upgrade`/`full-upgrade`) refuses to install or remove packages to satisfy new dependencies. On stable Debian/Ubuntu this is rare; on rolling/HWE/kernel-meta updates it's common (e.g. `linux-generic` jumps to a new kernel package name).

**Root cause:** `backend/scripts/wisp-os-update` (debian branch, `upgrade` action) runs `apt-get upgrade -y`. Conservative by design but mismatches what users expect from a "Upgrade" button — they assume "apply everything" semantics.

**Fix sketch:**
1. Switch the debian `upgrade` branch to `apt-get dist-upgrade -y` (alias `full-upgrade`). Same lock-detection wrapper pattern already in place.
2. Confirm the simulated count from `apt-get -s upgrade` (used by the `check`/`list` actions) still matches what `dist-upgrade` will install — it likely won't for kernel-meta cases, so also switch the simulation to `apt-get -s dist-upgrade` for symmetry. Otherwise the count shown in the UI is "upgrade count" but the button performs "dist-upgrade".
3. Pacman path: `pacman -Syu` already does the equivalent of dist-upgrade; no change needed.
4. Doc: note the change in `docs/spec/HOST-MONITORING.md` (the OS Updates section).

**Spot test after fix:**
1. On a Debian/Ubuntu host with a kernel-meta update pending (`linux-generic` → new ABI), click Check — count should include the kept-back packages.
2. Click Upgrade — the kernel meta-package and its new kernel package should both install.
3. After upgrade, Check again — list should be empty (or only contain genuinely-blocked items like phased updates).

**Why deferred:** Behavior change with safety implications (dist-upgrade can remove packages). Wants explicit decision before flipping the default — possibly a setting or a confirmation in the UI ("show what will be removed"). Discovered while fixing concurrency/caching, scope-separated.
